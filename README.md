An inverse mixed initial-boundary value problem for the heat equation in a rectangular domain was solved using the DeepXDE framework.
The goal of the work was to restore the unknown coefficient in the equation based on the temperature field measured at the last moment of time using deep learning methods.
As part of the project, a neural network was developed that can determine the unknown coefficient.
